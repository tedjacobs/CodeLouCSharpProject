This is an editable list of Disney animated Films.
It could be replicated to contain a list of any group of movies but I chose to use just Disney animated movies.
You can view and edit the already compiled list and add or delete new items.
I came up with this idea when I was trying to look at a list of movies and determine the ones that I had versus the ones that i needed.


To view the website, download the repository, open it in Visual Studio and look in Views/Home/Index and then running the program from there is a good starting point.  The Movies tab is where most of the magic happens (this is where you can view all of the CRUD operations).

Enjoy.
